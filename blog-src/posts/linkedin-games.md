About three months ago, I wrote a post on LinkedIn briefly speculating on the possibility that LinkedIn may be using it's
new games as a recruiting metric, and describing how I built a bot to solve one of them, the Queen's puzzle. At the time I was half-kidding; it seemed like there were simply too many problems with the idea such as ensuring the skills tested are meaningful and preventing cheating.

However, today I woke up to find that the post was taken down for violating LinkedIn community guidelines. This immediately piqued my interest; after all, I had not actually violated any guidelines, so what would incentivize LinkedIn to take down my post?

The first thing I did upon receiving this notice was to review the actual guidelines in question. Attached to my takedown notice was a citation of this particular clause ([you can review this section here](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies#illegal-and-inappropriate-commercial-activity)):

> We don't allow content that facilitates the purchase of illegal or dangerous goods and/or services, prostitution, and escort services. We don't allow content that promotes or distributes fake educational and/or professional certifications, sale of scraped data, proxy test-taking, or instructions on creating forged official documents. You may not use LinkedIn to hold lotteries, contests, sweepstakes, or giveaways. Do not use LinkedIn to sensationalize or capitalize on tragic events for commercial purposes.

Clearly a LinkedIn
